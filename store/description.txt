Supermarket Value Sort adds a "Value (Unit Price)" sort option to UK supermarket websites so you can instantly find the cheapest products per unit — per kg, per litre, per item, and more.

HOW IT WORKS

When you visit a supported supermarket's grocery pages, the extension:

• Adds a "Value (Unit Price)" option to the site's existing sort dropdown
• Automatically sorts products from cheapest to most expensive per unit on page load (configurable)
• Re-sorts when you navigate between categories or load more products

The extension reads the unit price already displayed on each product card (e.g. "£4.34/kg") and normalises different units so they're compared fairly. A product priced "per 100g" is correctly compared against one priced "per kg". Products without a unit price are moved to the bottom.

SUPPORTED SUPERMARKETS

• Tesco (tesco.com/groceries)
• Sainsbury's (sainsburys.co.uk/groceries)
• Waitrose (waitrose.com/ecom/shop)

Note: Morrisons, Ocado, and Asda already offer unit price sorting natively.

FEATURES

• One-click value sorting — instantly find the best deal
• Auto-sort on page load — toggle on/off from the popup
• Smart unit normalisation — compares kg vs 100g, litres vs 100ml, etc.
• Handles Tesco Clubcard prices — uses the lower of regular and Clubcard unit price
• Works with SPA navigation — re-applies when browsing between categories
• Survives React re-renders — the sort option persists even when the page dynamically updates

PRIVACY

This extension runs entirely in your browser. It makes zero network requests, collects no data, and sends nothing to any server. The only data stored is your auto-sort preference, saved locally on your device using chrome.storage.local. No analytics, no tracking, no third-party services.

PERMISSIONS

The extension only requests the "storage" permission — used solely for remembering your auto-sort preference. It has no access to your tabs, browsing history, or any other browser data.
